## Problem Description
The Dining Philosophers Problem is a classic synchronization challenge in computer science where multiple philosophers (threads/processes) share limited resources (forks). Each philosopher alternates between eating, sleeping, and thinking. To eat, a philosopher must acquire two adjacent forks without deadlocks or starvation .

**Project Requirements**:
- Prevent philosopher starvation
- Avoid data races and deadlocks
- Handle variable number of philosophers
- Monitor philosopher states to prevent death by starvation
- Support optional meal count termination

## Features

### Mandatory (Threads/Mutexes) üîß
| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Philosopher Threads | Each philosopher as separate thread |
| Fork Management | Mutex-protected fork array |
| Death Monitoring | Dedicated monitor thread |
| State Logging | Timestamped protected output |
| Meal Counting | Optional termination condition |


## Installation

### Requirements
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- GNU Make
- POSIX-compliant system

### Compilation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Nazar963/42_philosopher.git
cd 42_philosopher

# Compile mandatory part
make
```

## Usage

### Mandatory Syntax
```bash
./philo <number_of_philos> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> \
[number_of_meals]
```

### Examples
```bash
# 4 philosophers, die after 310ms without eating, 
# take 200ms to eat, 200ms to sleep, no meal limit
./philo 4 310 200 200

# 5 philosophers with 7 meal limit
./philo_bonus 5 800 200 200 7
```

### Output Format
```
[timestamp] [philo_id] [action]
```
Actions: `has taken a fork`, `is eating`, `is sleeping`, `is thinking`, `died`

## Algorithm

### Mandatory Solution
![Philosophers Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nazar963/42_Philosopher/main/images/graph.png)

### Key Techniques
1. **Deadlock Prevention**:  
   - Resource hierarchy (odd/even philosopher differentiation)
   - Timed lock acquisition attempts

2. **Starvation Avoidance**:  
   - Fair scheduling through turn-based eating
   - Priority inheritance for mutexes

3. **Data Race Prevention**:  
   - Mutex-protected shared memory access
   - Atomic operations for state changes 

## Testing

### Standard Tests
```bash
# Normal execution (should not die)
./philo 4 410 200 200

# Death simulation
./philo 4 310 200 200

# Meal termination
./philo 5 800 200 200 7
```

### Advanced Testing

1. **Memory Leak Check**:  
   ```bash
   valgrind --leak-check=full ./philo 4 410 200 200
   ```

2. **Performance Stress Test**:  
   ```bash
   ./philo 200 800 200 200
   ```
